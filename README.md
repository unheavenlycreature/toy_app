# Toy App

This repo contains the rails toy app from Chapter 2 of Michael Hartl's [Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/), done as a [project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/getting-your-feet-wet) from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

In short, this toy app implements *extremely* basic functionality for a microblog platform like Twitter, with the purpose of showing just how much code is generated using `ruby generate scaffolding` commands.
